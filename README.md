This project intends to create a college inquiry Chabot that responds to any questions posted by students on the college, its courses, and its location. In order to assess user questions and comprehend user messages, machine learning methods were used in the development of the College Enquiry Chatbot project. This System is a web application that offers the requested information. Through the system, the User can look for any college-related activity. The consumer does not need to visit the college in person to inquire. After analysing the query, the system responds to the user. The system responds with a powerful Graphical User Interface that gives the user the impression that a real person is speaking to them.
